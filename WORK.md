# Work Progress

## Current Sprint: Git-Tag-Based Semversioning Implementation

### Completed
- âœ… Analyzed codebase structure (Python package with Hatch build system)
- âœ… Read existing documentation and code
- âœ… Created comprehensive PLAN.md with technical architecture
- âœ… Created TODO.md with detailed task breakdown

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Setting up dynamic versioning system with hatch-vcs

### Next Steps
1. Configure hatch-vcs plugin for git-tag-based versioning
2. Update pyproject.toml configuration
3. Remove hardcoded version and implement dynamic version detection
4. Test version detection with mock git tags

### Notes
- Project uses Hatch build system (good for dynamic versioning)
- Existing test suite is minimal but functional
- Current version is hardcoded as "0.1.0"
- Need to maintain backward compatibility during transition
